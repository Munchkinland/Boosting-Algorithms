This repository contains an exploration and implementation of boosting algorithms for classification tasks.

The project delves into the fundamentals of boosting algorithms, including their theoretical underpinnings and practical applications. It also provides an implementation of two popular boosting algorithms, XGBoost and LightGBM, using the Python libraries xgboost and lightgbm.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

src: This directory contains the source code for the project, including Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training, and Python scripts for saving and loading models.

data: This directory contains the dataset used for the project, namely the diabetes.csv file.

models: This directory stores the trained models generated during the project.

Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need the following prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm
Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Munchkinland/Boosting-Algorithms.git

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter notebook explore.ipynb to explore the dataset and understand the characteristics of the data.

Train the XGBoost and LightGBM models using the scripts train_xgboost.py and train_lightgbm.py, respectively. These scripts load the data, prepare the features and target variable, and train the models.

Evaluate the performance of the trained models using the evaluate_models.py script. This script loads the trained models, makes predictions on the test data, and calculates the accuracy and other relevant metrics.
